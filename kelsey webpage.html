    <!-- Paragraph about my dad -->
        <p> I want to start off by saying <strong>Happy Birthday Dad!!!</strong> You're getting so old its hard to keep up with your actual age.
        You should be about <em>51</em> I believe so. I know you are probably wondering why I decided to make a webpage as your gift. Honestly 
        its mainly because shopping for you is <ins>soooo hard.</ins> 
        did not love doing it as much as computer engineering. I only decided to do the electrical part because it was a couple extra classes.
           </p>

     <!-- Paragraph about my job experience -->
        <p>Currently I am not working a job, but I do plan on getting one next semester. Before I came to State, I used to work at a foster care agency. 
        It was really nice being able to help kids in the system. My <strong>dream job</strong> would typically be one that allows me to <ins>travel</ins>
        the world, pays a lot, is something I <em>enjoy</em> doing.</p>
